              r"""The first director of the Polytechnic Prince A.G. Gagarin ordered to equip two tennis courts and to take "a large hall down the first dormitory" for "ping-pong". A special gym was soon added. Many famous athletes emerged from the polytechnic environment: the world volleyball champion Y.V. Aroshidze (1960), the world chess champion M.M. Botvinnik (1948-1963), the Olympic champion and the world skating champion E. Kulikov (1970) and others. The Polytechnic University now has a modern complex of sports facilities. It includes swimming pool, basketball and volleyball halls, wrestling and boxing halls, gymnasium, ski base, climbing ground, centre of valeology and rehabilitation centre for students with pronounced health disorders, weightlifting hall, chess club, training base in Kargolovo. There is also an office for medical control, massage and psycho-regulatory training, laboratories for health testing. In a vast space, near the old park, there is a stadium with two football fields and a hockey box, a tennis court, a gymnastics town and playgrounds. All this facilities allow the Department of Physical Culture to conduct diverse and valuable work with students and to educate masters of great sports.""",
              r"In 1932 was started the construction of a high-voltage building with a unique high-voltage testing room. In the 1960s, under the leadership of Professor H.N. Alexandrov, a unique ultra-high voltage laboratory was built with an external test stand, including a transformer cascade, which later led to the creation of superhigh-voltage transmissions 1150 kV. The complex has currently completed its tasks. All the necessary tests have been carried out and the necessary technologies have been developed. Nowadays the complex is de-energized and stands an impressive monument of fundamental Soviet science.",
              r"The Hydraulic Tower was established in 1905 as one of the oldest buildings of the university. The design of the Art Nouveau Tower was designed by architects Virrich and Padlewski. During the construction of the main building, the water supply was provided by a temporary wooden tower, which was replaced by a new stone structure. This architectural building became a place for hydrological research and an observation post for air defence during the Great Patriotic War and the blockade of Leningrad.",
